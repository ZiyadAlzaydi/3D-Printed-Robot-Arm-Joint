# 3D-Printed-Robot-Arm-Joint
This project involves creating a mechanical joint component for a robot arm. The joint is modeled in CAD, exported as an .STL file, and prepared for 3D printing using the AnkerMake Studio slicer software.

Strength (Modified)
Wall Loops (Perimeters): 4 loops — increased from default to improve structural strength, especially important for load-bearing joints.

Support (Modified)
Support Material: Enabled (General Support) — ensures proper printing of overhangs and bridging areas within the joint geometry.

Estimated Print Stats
Filament used: ~11.78 meters (35.97 g)

Print time: ~1 hour 55 minutes

Why PETG?
PETG was chosen due to:

High mechanical strength

Resistance to stress and fatigue

Minimal warping (better than ABS, stronger than PLA)
